# Technical Interview Assignment

## Overview

Welcome! We know your time is valuable. This assignment is designed to take about **2–3 hours**, and we're much more interested in your thought process than in a perfect product. If you don't finish everything, that's completely fine — just be ready to walk us through what you'd do next.

**What we're looking for:** How you think about building features, make architectural decisions, and work with an existing codebase.

**Presentation**: 1.5 hours (demo + discussion)

## Context

This is a production-ready SaaS starter kit built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and TypeScript. It already has user authentication, profile management, and a basic dashboard. Your task is to add a new feature that integrates with the existing architecture.

## The Assignment

### Build a Task Management MVP

You're building the first version of a task management feature. We have some user feedback, but we need you to help define what the MVP should look like.

**User feedback we've received:**
- "I need to track things I need to do"
- "I want to see what's completed vs. what's still pending"
- "Sometimes I need to add notes or details to tasks"
- "It would be nice to organize tasks somehow - maybe by priority or category?"
- "In the future, we might want to work on tasks together as a team"

**Core requirements:**

Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. Beyond that, **you decide** what else to include based on the feedback above. Think about what's essential for an MVP vs. what can wait for v2.

**Design for the future:**

Keep in mind that users will eventually want to **collaborate on tasks with team members**. You don't need to implement this, but your database schema and architecture should make it possible without a major rewrite. Be ready to discuss your approach.

## What to Prioritize

Focus on:
- **Clear, readable code** that follows the existing patterns in the codebase
- **Core functionality** that works end-to-end
- **Thoughtful decisions** about what to include/exclude and why
- **Basic security** (especially around data access)

Don't worry about:
- Pixel-perfect design
- Extensive testing (though mentioning your testing strategy is great)
- Advanced features like real-time updates or notifications

## Deliverables

1. **Working implementation** - A functional task management feature
2. **Your reasoning** - Notes or comments explaining key decisions (can be verbal during the presentation)

## Presentation Format (1.5 hours)

**Demo & Walkthrough (45 minutes)**
- Show what you built and how it works
- Walk through your code and key decisions
- Explain what you'd do with more time

**AI-Driven Development (15 minutes)**
- Show how you used AI tools during implementation
- Discuss your workflow and best practices
- Share where AI helped most vs. where you relied on your own judgment

**Technical Discussion (30 minutes)**
- Your approach to the collaboration requirement
- Alternative implementations you considered
- Trade-offs and architectural decisions
- Q&A

## Questions?

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and be ready to explain your reasoning. We want to see how you handle ambiguity.

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach.
